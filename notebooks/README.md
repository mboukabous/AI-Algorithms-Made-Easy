#### Overview
This notebook focuses on training supervised regression models using Python and popular machine learning libraries. It is designed to guide users through the following steps:

1. **Dataset Management**:
   - Instructions for downloading datasets directly from Kaggle or using your dataset for training.

2. **Preprocessing**:
   - Comprehensive data preprocessing using pipelines, including handling missing values, scaling numerical features, and encoding categorical features.

3. **Model Training**:
   - Step-by-step training of various regression models:
     - Linear Regression
     - Ridge Regression
     - Lasso Regression
     - ElasticNet Regression
     - Decision Tree
     - Random Forest (Bagging)
     - Gradient Boosting (Boosting)
     - AdaBoost (Boosting)
     - XGBoost (Boosting)
     - LightGBM
     - CatBoost
     - Support Vector Regressor (SVR)
     - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Regressor
     - Extra Trees Regressor
     - Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) Regressor

4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
   - Demonstrates the use of `GridSearchCV` for efficient hyperparameter optimization.

5. **Results**:
   - Saving trained models, metrics, and other outputs for further analysis.

#### Key Features
- **Stand-Alone Sections**: 
  Each section can be executed independently, allowing flexibility in workflow.
- **Interactive Learning**: 
  Contains markdown cells with detailed explanations, making it beginner-friendly.
- **Scalable Pipelines**:
  Shows how to create robust preprocessing and modeling pipelines using `scikit-learn`.

#### Usage
1. Open the notebook in a Jupyter environment or Google Colab.
2. Follow the instructions in each section to train and evaluate regression models.
3. Customize the code as needed for your specific dataset and modeling requirements.
